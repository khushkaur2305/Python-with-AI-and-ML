# 🗓️ Day 18 – Project Presentation, Evaluation & Final Reflection

## ✅ Topic Covered
**Presentation and Evaluation of Final Project – Disaster Relief Aid Prediction System**

---

## 🧠 Summary
Today marked the **final stage** of our AI & ML training — the **presentation and evaluation** of our project *“Disaster Relief Aid Prediction System.”*  
This day was focused on **showcasing the complete end-to-end project**: from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and results visualization.  

We demonstrated how the system can predict **the type and amount of aid required** during different disaster events, based on historical data patterns.  
It was an exciting and proud moment — seeing weeks of hard work come together into a real, impactful solution that could be used in the real world.

The evaluation was based on **clarity, model performance, creativity, documentation, and presentation skills.**

## 📊 Evaluation Questions Asked by the Instructor
| Question | My Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| What inspired your project idea? | I wanted to apply ML to a real-world humanitarian challenge — disaster management — where data can make a meaningful impact. |
| Why did you choose regression models over classification? | Because the goal was to predict a **continuous value** (aid amount), not a category. Regression models fit this objective better. |
| Which preprocessing techniques did you use? | Missing value imputation, label encoding, scaling, and outlier detection using IQR. |
| Why was Random Forest selected as the final model? | It provided the highest R² score (0.88) and lowest RMSE, showing robust performance compared to other algorithms. |
| What challenges did you face during data collection? | Inconsistent data formats, missing entries, and imbalanced records across different disaster types. |
| How can your model be improved in the future? | By integrating live weather data, using deep learning models, and deploying an interactive dashboard for real-time aid prediction. |
