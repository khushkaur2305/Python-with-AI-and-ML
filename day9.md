## ✅ Topic Covered
**Introduction to Python Libraries** and **Numpy Library**  

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on understanding **Python Libraries** and the **Numpy library**, which is widely used for **numerical computations**. We explored:

### Python Libraries:
- Libraries are **collections of pre-written code** (modules) that simplify programming.  
- Examples include `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `os`, and specialized libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`.  
- Libraries save time, improve productivity, and provide efficient tools for specific tasks.  

### Numpy Library:
- **Numpy (Numerical Python)** is used for **numerical operations** and **array handling**.  
- It provides **high-performance multidimensional arrays**, mathematical functions, and linear algebra capabilities.  
- Key features:  
  - `ndarray` for n-dimensional arrays  
  - Mathematical operations on arrays  
  - Shape manipulation, indexing, slicing, and broadcasting  

Analogies helped: think of **libraries** as **toolkits**, and **Numpy arrays** as **high-speed containers for numbers**.
