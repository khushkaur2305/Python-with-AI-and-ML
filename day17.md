# 🗓️ Day 17 – Disaster Relief Aid Prediction Project

## ✅ Topic Covered
**Final Project: Disaster Relief Aid Prediction System using Machine Learning**

---

## 🧠 Summary
Today marked the completion and presentation of our **Final Machine Learning Project**, titled **“Disaster Relief Aid Prediction System.”**  
This project aimed to build a **predictive model** that can estimate the **type and amount of aid required** during various natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, droughts, and storms.  

The objective was to apply all the **knowledge and skills** gained throughout the AI & ML training — including **Python programming**, **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation** — to solve a **real-world humanitarian problem**.  

The project demonstrated how **data-driven approaches** and **machine learning algorithms** can assist governments and NGOs in efficiently **allocating disaster relief resources**, ultimately saving time and lives.

- Understood the end-to-end **workflow of ML model building** — from data collection to deployment.  
- Gained hands-on experience with:
  - **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
  - **Feature selection and encoding**
  - **Supervised regression algorithms**
  - **Model performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² score**
- Realized how **AI can play a vital role** in improving humanitarian aid planning and logistics.

## 🧪 Project Methodology

### 🧹 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Collected and prepared **historical disaster data** from international and Indian government sources.  
- Handled **missing values** using imputation techniques (mean, median, and mode).  
- Converted **categorical variables** (like disaster type and region) into numeric form using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.  
- Normalized numerical columns to ensure consistent scaling for model training.

### 🔍 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to understand relationships between disaster severity and aid contribution.  
- Identified **patterns and trends**, such as which disaster types receive the highest aid.  
- Analyzed correlation between **Severity Index**, **Total Deaths**, and **Aid Contribution**.

### ⚙️ 3. Feature Engineering
- Created new derived features such as:
  - **Severity Ratio** = (Deaths + Injured) / Affected Population  
  - **Disaster Impact Index** combining severity and region-based risk  
- Used **feature importance analysis** to select the most relevant predictors for the model.

### 🤖 4. Model Training and Evaluation
- Implemented multiple supervised learning algorithms:
  - **Decision Tree Regressor**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
- Evaluated models using:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
  - **R² Score**
- Found **Random Forest Regressor** to perform best with an **R² Score of 0.88**, indicating strong predictive capability.

### 📊 5. Prediction and Results
- The final model accurately predicted the **aid amount and type** for simulated disaster scenarios.  
- Built visual dashboards and bar graphs showing **aid predictions by disaster category**.  
- Demonstrated that the model could be used to **forecast future aid requirements** during real disaster events.
