# 📘 Day 10  

## ✅ Topic Covered
Introduction to **Matplotlib Library** and Basic Data Visualization in Python  

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on understanding **Matplotlib**, a **powerful Python library for creating 2D and 3D plots**. We explored:

- Importing Matplotlib and using the `pyplot` module  
- Plotting simple **line charts** and **scatter plots**  
- Customizing plots: titles, labels, legends, colors, and markers  
- Understanding **figure and axes objects**  
- Saving plots using `savefig()`  
- Basic plotting functions: `plot()`, `scatter()`, `bar()`, `hist()`  

Matplotlib helps in **visualizing data**, identifying trends, and presenting results clearly. Analogies helped: think of Matplotlib as a **digital canvas**, where you can draw charts and graphs to represent data.
