# 📘 Day 13  

## ✅ Topic Covered
**Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML)** 

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on understanding the basics of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. We explored:

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- AI is the simulation of **human intelligence** in machines.  
- Tasks include problem-solving, reasoning, learning, perception, and language understanding.  
- AI can be categorized into **Narrow AI** (specialized tasks) and **General AI** (human-like intelligence).  

### Machine Learning (ML)
- ML is a subset of AI that allows machines to **learn from data** and make decisions without explicit programming.  
- ML models improve their performance as they are exposed to more data.  
- Steps in ML: **Data Collection → Preprocessing → Training → Evaluation → Prediction**

## 🧪 Types of Machine Learning

| Type                  | Description                                                   | Example Use Case                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Supervised Learning   | Model is trained on **labeled data** (input → output pairs)  | Email spam detection, Price prediction     |
| Unsupervised Learning | Model finds **patterns in unlabeled data**                    | Customer segmentation, Market basket analysis |
| Reinforcement Learning| Model **learns by trial and error**, receiving rewards/penalties | Self-driving cars, Game AI                  |
| Semi-supervised Learning | Combination of labeled and unlabeled data                   | Fraud detection, Medical diagnosis         |
| Self-supervised Learning | Model generates labels from data itself                     | Language models like GPT, BERT             |

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- AI is the broader concept of **machines performing intelligent tasks**, ML is a **subset of AI** focusing on learning from data.  
- Supervised learning uses **labeled datasets**, while unsupervised learning deals with **patterns without labels**.  
- Reinforcement learning involves **agents, environments, rewards, and actions**.  
- Semi-supervised and self-supervised learning help handle **large unlabeled datasets efficiently**.
