# 📘 Day 14  

## ✅ Topic Covered
**Supervised Learning**  

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on **Supervised Learning**, a type of machine learning where the model is trained on **labeled data** (input → output pairs). The model learns the mapping from inputs to outputs and can predict unseen data.  

### Key Steps in Supervised Learning:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather labeled data for training.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, normalize, and split data into training and testing sets.  
3. **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable algorithm.  
4. **Training:** Fit the model to training data.  
5. **Evaluation:** Test the model on unseen data and measure performance.  
6. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict new data.
