## ✅ Topic Covered
**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and Key Concepts  

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on understanding **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, a type of machine learning where an **agent learns to make decisions** by interacting with an environment to **maximize cumulative rewards**.  

### Key Concepts:
- **Agent:** Learner or decision-maker (e.g., a robot or software program).  
- **Environment:** The external system the agent interacts with.  
- **State (S):** Current situation or configuration of the environment.  
- **Action (A):** Choices available to the agent in a state.  
- **Reward (R):** Feedback from the environment after an action.  
- **Policy (π):** Strategy used by the agent to decide actions.  
- **Value Function (V):** Expected cumulative reward from a state.  
- **Exploration vs Exploitation:** Balancing trying new actions and using known best actions.  

RL is **different from supervised and unsupervised learning** because it learns through **trial and error**, not labeled data.

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- Reinforcement Learning focuses on **learning optimal behavior through interaction**, not static data.  
- **Reward design** is crucial for effective learning.  
- Balancing **exploration (try new actions)** and **exploitation (use best-known actions)** is key.  
- RL algorithms can be **model-free** (learn from experience) or **model-based** (learn environment dynamics).

## 💻 Activity
- Discussed RL concepts using real-life examples like **self-driving cars, games, and robotics**.  
- Differentiated RL from supervised and unsupervised learning.  
- Explored Q-Learning and Policy Gradient methods conceptually.  
- Created a small conceptual diagram showing **agent-environment interaction**.

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
Understanding **Q-tables, value functions** required careful visualization and examples.  

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Reinforcement Learning is **ideal for decision-making tasks** in dynamic environments where **trial-and-error learning** and **delayed rewards** are involved.
