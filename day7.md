# 📘 Day 07  

## ✅ Topic Covered
Deep Dive into **Python Operators and Functions**, Practical Applications and Usage  

## 🧠 Summary
Today’s session focused on understanding **Python Operators** and **Functions**, which are fundamental to performing operations and modularizing code. We explored:

### Operators:
- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`  
- **Comparison Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`  
- **Logical Operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`  
- **Assignment Operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.  
- **Membership & Identity Operators:** `in`, `not in`, `is`, `is not`  

### Functions:
- Declaring and defining functions using `def`  
- Passing parameters and returning values  
- Understanding **scope**: local vs global variables  
- Using **built-in functions** like `len()`, `type()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`  
- Understanding **modular code** and **reusability** through functions  

Analogies helped in understanding: **operators** are like tools for performing calculations, while **functions** are like mini-machines that take input, process it, and give output.

| Concept/Feature         | Example                                  | Purpose/Use Case                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Arithmetic Operators     | `a + b`, `a ** b`                        | Perform numeric calculations                 |
| Comparison Operators     | `a > b`                                  | Compare values                               |
| Logical Operators        | `(a > 5) and (b < 10)`                   | Combine multiple conditions                  |
| Assignment Operators     | `a += 5`                                 | Update variable values                        |
| Membership Operators     | `'a' in 'apple'`                         | Check membership                              |
| Identity Operators       | `a is b`                                 | Check if variables reference the same object |
| Function Definition      | `def greet(name): return "Hello " + name`| Encapsulate reusable logic                   |
| Function Call            | `greet("Khush")`                          | Execute function and get result             |
| Parameters & Return      | `def add(a, b): return a + b`            | Pass values and return results              |
| Built-in Functions       | `len("Hello")`, `sum([1,2,3])`          | Use Python’s pre-defined functionality      |

## 🔍 New Concepts Learned
- Operators allow **efficient computation** and **logical decisions**.  
- Functions allow **code reuse**, **better organization**, and **modularity**.  
- Understanding function **parameters and return values** is crucial for designing reusable code.  
- Scope of variables determines where a variable is **accessible** in the program.  

---

## 💻 Activity
- Practiced arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, membership, and identity operators.  
- Declared and called multiple functions with parameters and return values.  
- Used built-in functions to simplify operations.  
- Explored scope by using local and global variables.  

---

## 🤔 Challenges Faced
Initially, understanding **difference between `is` vs `==`** and **global vs local scope** required some trial and error.  

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Operators help perform **specific tasks**, while functions help **organize and modularize code**. Combining both leads to clean, reusable, and efficient programs.
