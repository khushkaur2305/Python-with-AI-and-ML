## üß† Summary
Today officially marked the beginning of my journey into Python programming.  
We started with the **basics of setting up the Python environment**, ensuring that Python runs properly on the system, and explored different **development environments** (IDEs) used for writing and executing code.

I learned that **Python is an interpreted, high-level, dynamically typed, and object-oriented programming language**.  
It emphasizes **readability, simplicity, and flexibility**, which is why it‚Äôs one of the most popular languages in the world ‚Äî especially in fields like **Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Web Development, and Automation**.

## üêç What is Python?
Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991** and named after the famous comedy series *‚ÄúMonty Python‚Äôs Flying Circus.‚Äù*  
The language was designed with the philosophy of making code **easy to read, write, and maintain**, while still being **powerful enough** for complex applications.

Python‚Äôs main goal is to make developers focus on **solving problems**, not worrying about syntax or memory management.
